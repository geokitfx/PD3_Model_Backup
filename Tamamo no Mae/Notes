I made Tamamo no Mae Blue Magician Wear work in this, it took me over a week, I can't figure out how to fix the issue where the sleeves block most of the screen, so if you want this you'll just have to deal with it.

At least you can have her as a companion with 0 Issue.

Models are orginally from the Fate/EXTELLA game series

FIRST EVER TAMAMO NO MAE MOD FOR PAYDAY 3

Gonna hate myself later, but I plan and doing a bunch of other models.
